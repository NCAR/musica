    "\n",
    "The [TUV-x photolysis calculator](https://github.com/ncar/tuv-x) is available as part of the MUSICA library. TUV-x can be used to calculate photolysis rate constants for a given set of conditions. It can also be used to calculate exposure metrics (\"dose rates\" in TUV-x lingo) based on the calculated radiation field.\n",
    "\n",
    "TUV-x can be configured for any number of photolysis and dose rate calculations. We also provide two standard configurations in the MUSICA Python package:\n",
    "- v5.4: A TUV-x configuration that corresponds to the original [TUV 5.4 model](https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/modeling/tuv-download)\n",
    "- vTS1/TSMLT: A TUV-x configuration for use with the MOZART TS1 and TSMLT chemical mechanisms\n",

    "\n",
    "To get started, we'll use the two standard TUV-x configurations to calculate the rate constants for O3 photolysis. We include rate constants for both $\\text{O}_3$ photolysis branches (forming $\\text{O(1D)}$ or $\\text{O(3P)}$)."

The v5.4 and vTS1/TSMLT configurations include the same set of standard environmental conditions to facilitate comparisons. The environmental conditions and results from TUV-x are for a vertical atmosphere column. The standard conditions use a column with 120 layers of 1-km height per layer. TUV-x can be configured to work with columns with any number of layers.\n",
