    The MICM class is a wrapper around the C++ MICM solver. It provides methods to create a solver,
    create a state, and solve the system of equations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config_path : FilePath
        Path to the configuration file.
    mechanism : mechanism_configuration.Mechanism
        Mechanism object which specifies the chemical mechanism to use.
    solver_type : SolverType
        Type of solver to use.
    number_of_grid_cells : int
        Number of grid cells to use. The default is 1.

        ----------
            config_path : FilePath, optional

            solver_type : SolverType, optional
