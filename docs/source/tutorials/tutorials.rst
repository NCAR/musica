MUSICA offers a series of tutorial snippets in Fortran as well as tutorial notebooks in Python that guide users from simple workflows to more advanced simulations, both available here.

Fortran
========
1. :ref:`installing MUSICA <installing_musica>`
2. :ref:`first Fortran MUSICA program <chapter1>`
3. :ref:`box model example <chapter2>`


Python
========
The Python tutorials are written in `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_ Notebooks and made available in multiple formats below for ease of access.


Interactive Notebooks
----------------------
The MUSICA repository utilizes `Binder <https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#>`_ to allow users to interact with the tutorial notebooks on a `JupyterHub <https://jupyter.org/hub>`_.
Each of the links below will open a JupyterHub set up with all necessary dependencies to run each tutorial:

1. `working with multiple grid cells <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NCAR/musica/173524036cf15abfab59ea9b64818a7a27ae4be0?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Ftutorial%2F1.%20multiple_grid_cells.ipynb>`_
2. `latin hypercube sampling <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NCAR/musica/173524036cf15abfab59ea9b64818a7a27ae4be0?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Ftutorial%2F2.%20hypercube.ipynb>`_
3. `user-defined reactions <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NCAR/musica/173524036cf15abfab59ea9b64818a7a27ae4be0?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Ftutorial%2F3.%20user_defined_reactions.ipynb>`_
4. `local paralellization <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NCAR/musica/173524036cf15abfab59ea9b64818a7a27ae4be0?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Ftutorial%2F4.%20local_parallelization.ipynb>`_
5. `HPC parallelization <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NCAR/musica/173524036cf15abfab59ea9b64818a7a27ae4be0?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Ftutorial%2F5.%20hpc_parallelization.ipynb>`_
6. `using GPU solvers <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NCAR/musica/173524036cf15abfab59ea9b64818a7a27ae4be0?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Ftutorial%2F6.%20gpu_solver.ipynb>`_

GitHub
--------
For users that wish to directly download local copies of the tutorial notebooks, they are each made available on our GitHub within the `tutorials <https://github.com/NCAR/musica/tree/main/tutorial>`_ folder. Each notebook is also linked below:
