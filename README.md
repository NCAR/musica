Multi-Scale Infrastructure for Chemistry and Aerosols

MUSICA is a collection of modeling software, tools, and grids, that
allow for robust modeling of chemistry in Earth's atmosphere.

At present the project encompasses these components
- [TUV-x](https://github.com/NCAR/tuv-x)
    - A photolysis rate calculator 

- [MICM](https://github.com/NCAR/micm)
    - Model Independent Chemical Module

## Available grids

Pre-made grids for use in MUSICA are available [here](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/MUSICA/Available+Grids).

## Developer Options

### Specifying dependency versions via paramaterization at configure time

Introduced in [Pull Request #124](https://github.com/NCAR/musica/pull/124), it is possible for developers to specify which versions of various dependencies should be used. These options are currently limited to those dependencies managed via `FetchContent`.  This change allows for more easily testing `musica` against changes committed in different repositories and branches.  The environmental variables introduced are outlined in the following table. 

#### CMake Dependency Variables

| Musica Dependency                                      | Repository                | Branch, Tag or Hash|
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------|--------------------|
| [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest.git)| GOOGLETEST_GIT_REPOSITORY | GOOGLETEST_GIT_TAG |
| [MICM](https://github.com/NCAR/mcim.git)               | MICM_GIT_REPOSITORY       | MICM_GIT_TAG       | 
| [TUV-X](https://github.com/NCAR/tuv-x.git)             | TUVX_GIT_REPOSITORY       | TUVX_GIT_TAG       |
| [PyBind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)         | PYBIND11_GIT_REPOSITORY   | PYBIND11_GIT_TAG   |

#### Example Usage

> The following examples assume the working directory is a `build/` directory inside the `musica` source directory.

Specifying a different version of `tuv-x`, to ensure a change won't break anything.

    $ cmake .. \
        -DTUVX_GIT_REPOSITORY="https://github.com/WardF/tuv-x.git" \
        -DTUVX_GIT_TAG=test-fix

Specifying a specific version of `tuv-x` by has, but using the official repository.

    $ cmake .. \
        -DTUVX_GIT_TAG=a6b2c4d8745


## Citing MUSICA

MUSICA can be cited in at least two ways. The first is to cite [the paper](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-19-0331.1) that defines the vision
of the MUSICA software. The bibtex entry below can be used to generate a citaiton for this.

```
