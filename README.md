Multi-Scale Infrastructure for Chemistry and Aerosols

MUSICA is a collection of modeling software, tools, and grids, that
allow for robust modeling of chemistry in Earth's atmosphere.

At present the project encompasses these core components
- [TUV-x](https://github.com/NCAR/tuv-x)
    - A photolysis rate calculator 

- [MICM](https://github.com/NCAR/micm)
    - Model Independent Chemical Module

- [Mechanism Configuration](https://github.com/NCAR/MechanismConfiguration)
    - The standardized format to describe atmospheric chemistry

These components are used to drive the MUSICA software ecosystem. This is a snapshot of how MUSICA can be used with different
models.

# Installation
MUSICA is installable via pip for Python or CMake for C++. 

## Pip
```
pip install musica
```

## CMake
```
$ git clone https://github.com/NCAR/musica.git
$ cd musica
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ccmake ..
$ make
$ make install
```

# Using the MUSICA Python API
MUSICA makes its chemical mechanism analysis and visualization available through a Python API. The following example works through solving a simple chemistry system. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://ncar.github.io/musica/index.html) for further tutorials and examples.
```python
# --- Import Musica ---
import musica
import musica.mechanism_configuration as mc

# --- 1. Define the chemical system of interest ---
A = mc.Species(name="A")
B = mc.Species(name="B")
C = mc.Species(name="C")
species = [A, B, C]
gas = mc.Phase(name="gas", species=species)

# --- 2. Define a mechanism of interest ---
# Through Musica, several different mechanisms can be explored to define reaction rates. Here, we use the Arrhenius equation as a simple example.

r1 = mc.Arrhenius(name="A->B", A=4.0e-3, C=50, reactants=[A], products=[B], gas_phase=gas)
r2 = mc.Arrhenius(name="B->C", A=1.2e-4, B=2.5, C=75, D=50, E=0.5, reactants=[B], products=[C], gas_phase=gas)

mechanism = mc.Mechanism(name="musica_example", species=species, phases=[gas], reactions=[r1, r2])

# --- 3. Create MICM solver ---
# A solver must be initialized with either a configuration file or a mechanism:

solver = musica.MICM(mechanism=mechanism, solver_type=musica.SolverType.rosenbrock_standard_order)

# --- 4. Define environmental conditions ---
temperature=300.0
pressure=101000.0

# --- 5. Create and initialize State ---
# In the model, conditions represent the starting environment for the reactions and are assigned by modifying the state.

state = solver.create_state()
state.set_concentrations({"A": 1.0, "B": 3.0, "C": 5.0})
state.set_conditions(temperature, pressure)
initial_pressure = state.get_conditions()['air_density'][0] # store for visualization and output

# --- 6. Time parameters ---
time_step = 4  # stepping
sim_length = 20  # total simulation time

# --- (Optional) 7. Save initial state (t=0) for output visualization ---
initial_row = {"time.s": 0.0, "ENV.temperature.K": temperature, "ENV.pressure.Pa": pressure, "ENV.air number density.mol m-3": state.get_conditions()['air_density'][0]}
initial_row.update({f"CONC.{k}.mol m-3": v[0] for k, v in state.get_concentrations().items()})

# --- 8. Solve through time loop only ---
# The following loop simply solves the model per each time step:

curr_time = time_step
while curr_time <= sim_length:
    solver.solve(state, time_step)
    concentrations = state.get_concentrations()
    curr_time += time_step

# --- 9. Solve and create DataFrame ---
# It is likely more useful to solve at each time step and store the associated data:
import pandas as pd

output_data = [] # prepare to store output per time step
output_data.append(initial_row) # save t=0 data

curr_time = time_step
while curr_time <= sim_length:
    solver.solve(state, time_step)
    row = {
        "time.s": curr_time,
        "ENV.temperature.K": state.get_conditions()['temperature'][0],
        "ENV.pressure.Pa": state.get_conditions()['pressure'][0],
        "ENV.air number density.mol m-3": state.get_conditions()['air_density'][0]
    }
    row.update({f"CONC.{k}.mol m-3": v[0] for k, v in state.get_concentrations().items()})
    output_data.append(row)
    curr_time += time_step

df = pd.DataFrame(output_data)
print(df)

# --- 10. Visualize Specific Results ---
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df.plot(x='time.s', y=['CONC.A.mol m-3', 'CONC.B.mol m-3', 'CONC.C.mol m-3'], title='Concentration over time', ylabel='Concentration (mol m-3)', xlabel='Time (s)')
plt.show()
```

# Available grids
Pre-made grids for use in MUSICA are available [here](https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/MUSICA/Available+Grids).

## Developer Options

### Specifying dependency versions via parameterization at configure time

Introduced in [Pull Request #124](https://github.com/NCAR/musica/pull/124), it is possible for developers to specify which versions of various dependencies should be used. These options are currently limited to those dependencies managed via `FetchContent`.  This change allows for more easily testing `musica` against changes committed in different repositories and branches.  The environmental variables introduced are outlined in the following table. 

#### CMake Dependency Variables

| Musica Dependency                                      | Repository                | Branch, Tag or Hash|
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------|--------------------|
| [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest.git)| GOOGLETEST_GIT_REPOSITORY | GOOGLETEST_GIT_TAG |
| [MICM](https://github.com/NCAR/micm.git)               | MICM_GIT_REPOSITORY       | MICM_GIT_TAG       | 
| [TUV-X](https://github.com/NCAR/tuv-x.git)             | TUVX_GIT_REPOSITORY       | TUVX_GIT_TAG       |
| [PyBind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)         | PYBIND11_GIT_REPOSITORY   | PYBIND11_GIT_TAG   |
| [Mechanism Configuration](https://github.com/NCAR/MechanismConfiguration.git) | MECH_CONFIG_GIT_REPOSITORY | MECH_CONFIG_GIT_TAG |

#### Example Usage

> The following examples assume the working directory is a `build/` directory inside the `musica` source directory.

Specifying a different version of `tuv-x`, to ensure a change won't break anything.

    $ cmake .. \
        -DTUVX_GIT_REPOSITORY="https://github.com/WardF/tuv-x.git" \
        -DTUVX_GIT_TAG=test-fix

Specifying a specific version of `tuv-x` by has, but using the official repository.

    $ cmake .. \
        -DTUVX_GIT_TAG=a6b2c4d8745


### Python build
Musica has python bindings. If you want to install the python package, you may `pip install musica`.

#### PyPi
If you only want to use the CPU components, 

```
pip install musica
```

Note that GPU support has only been tested on linux. If you have an NVIDIA GPU and would like to take 
advantage of our GPU solver, you must first [add the NVIDIA pypi index](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-quick-start-guide/#pip-wheels-linux) and then install musica with our gpu option.

```
pip install --upgrade setuptools pip wheel
pip install nvidia-pyindex
pip install musica[gpu]
```

#### Local build

Musica has python bindings. To build the package locally,

```
pip install -e .
```

If you have an NVIDIA GPU and cuda installed, you can enable a build of musica with GPU support by setting the environment 
variable `BUILD_GPU`.

```
BUILD_GPU=1 pip install -e .
```
